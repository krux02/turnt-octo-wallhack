# turnt-octo-wallhack
A projects to test the suitability of go for game development. It could be used as a reference on 
how to use GO and OpenGL development together.

This project will not be developed further, it was primarily to find out weather Go is the language I would want to develop a 
game in. Eventually I decided, that for me Go is not the language I want, and therefor this project is now stopped. 
But I still think this this project could be a nice example to show how OpenGL can be used in Go. 
The development of this game was done exclusively on Linux, no other platforms were tested. 

This project uses the AntTweakBar for a simple development UI, Assimp for model loading, an OpenGL binding and 
SDL2 for context creation and keyboard/mouse events, and a matrix vector library.

An interesting feature implemented here is working portals like in the game Portal (or Unreal, or Wheel of Time, or ...).
